    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p><a href="index.html">Return home</a></p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm passionate about using a bicycle as transportation, and I believe that in the winter, you shouldn't need a fat tire bike to get around everywhere! For me, this means I rely on the bike trails getting plowed, which is what gets reported here. However, I also like riding my bike for fun! It's a great way to get outside and experience what little sunlight there is in the winter. During the summer, I like going on long distance bike rides on my main bike, a 1970s Peugeot steel road bike. In the summer of 2025, I biked to Duluth from Minneapolis (~170 miles) and in the fall of 2025 I biked to Fergus Falls from Minneapolis (~208 miles).</p>
    <p>If I'm not riding my bike, I use the bus and light rail to get around primarily. I find using bike + public transit works really well, especially when some routes get less frequent at night.</p>
    <p>Aside from these things, I enjoy playing PC games (Counter-Strike, Binding of Isaac, osu!, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Team Fortress 2, and more), playing bar trivia, swimming, and going to concerts. Sometimes I edit Wikipedia in my free time as well. </p>
    <p>If you see me on my bike in the wild, say hi!</p>
