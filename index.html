      <p>Hello there! My name is Owen and I wanted to have a place where people can collectively report on cycling conditions in the Twin Cities metro without having to rely on social media. My main focus has been protected bicycle infrastructure.</p>
      <p><a href="aboutme.html">About me</a></p>

      <p>The information on this site is for informational use only. Ride at your own risk, especially in the winter.</p>

      <h2>How will this work?</h2>
      <p>The way this works is (at least for now, until I come up with a more sophisticated way to do this) to manually update the embedded map you see below. On this map, you should be able to see sections of bike trail that are <b>bold.</b> These lines will be <b>thicker</b> than the rest, and if you click on these segments it should give a trail status. I will also put text below in case you don't want to navigate the map.</p>
      <p>Lastly, keep in mind that these are opinions of myself and the people submitting. Based on the bikes people have or their comfort level, these subjective descriptions might clash another's experience.</p>
      <h3>The map will expire after heavy snowfall.</h3>
      <p>On this page, if we get over 2 inches of snowfall, all previous reports will be marked as "expired" (dark gray on map). The reason I picked that number is because that is the threshold at which the MPRB declares a snow event, and it will take time for everyone else to plow as well. I will make a note in the "Reports" section that a snow event occurred (based on how much snow we get), but I will keep the written reports. Part of my reasoning behind this is that reports from before the snow event will not be particularly useful. This approach will let users see previous reports to get an idea of what that trail looked like plowed. Reach out to me if you have a different view, I want to make this site as useful as possible!</p>
      <h3>Suggestions for submitting</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Tell me about your bike. Tire width and whether or not you have studs are the most important.</li>
        <li>Describe your route.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The most important part is what major bikeway(s) you took!</b> It doesn't need to be turn by turn directions if you don't have time.</li>
          <li>If you want to be more detailed, you could include a Strava link, a Ride with GPS link, screenshot of the route, or a typed out description.</li>
          <li>What were the conditions like? Did it feel plowed? Was it slippery, icy, did you feel comfortable on your bike?</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3>Colors for user reports</h3>
      <p><b style="color: lawngreen; background-color: black;">Green</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>fully</b> plowed.</p>
      <p><b style="color: orange; background-color: black;">Orange</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>partially</b> plowed. This will color mostly be used when the trail <em>was</em> plowed at some point, but the ride quality has gotten worse (subjective). For example, if it snowed <em>just enough</em> to not plow again and it's all slippery/bumpy, or if wake from the street plow throws a bunch of chunks on the trail, or if a painted bike lane is unusable.</p>
      <p><b style="color: yellow; background-color: black;">Yellow</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>unplowed</b>.</p>
      <p><b style="color: lightgray; background-color: black;">Gray</b> lines on the map represent <b>expired</b> reports from <b>before</b> a major snow event. These are there for context only, in case anyone wants to view old reports on the map easily.</p>
      <p><b style="color: palevioletred; background-color: black;">Pink</b> markers on the map represent large snow mounds at intersections.</p>
      <h3>Other colors</h3>
      <p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/">OpenCycleMap legend</a> for information on other colors. I try to choose colors that don't overlap with these.</p>

      <h2>How do I contact you to update this website?</h2>
      <p>Just like the good old days, send me an email. I will work to update this site quickly. Email me at <a href="mailto:mspwintercycle@gmail.com">mspwintercycle@gmail.com.</a> If you have any suggestions on how to improve this website, please let me know! Obviously having something more automated would be nice, but that seemed like a lot of work, and I wanted to get something up and running.</p>

    <div id="roadcycling">
      <h2>Can I report something that isn't a bike path/off street bike facility?</h2>
      <p>If you want to, of course. In my experience, painted bike lanes often become treacherous in the winter with a combination of slush, ice, and compacted snow. During snow events, however, roads usually get plowed first, so that information could be useful!</p>
      <p>I have had better success with plowing on "bicycle boulevards," such as 40th St (RiverLake Greenway). Information on these roads throughout the Twin Cities (usually they have "BLVD" painted on the asphalt) would be helpful in my opinion.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="privacy">
      <h2>How do you handle privacy?</h2>
      <p>I would encourage everyone submitting information to me to keep in mind this website is public. I won't include names of people who send things to me, and feel free to omit any part of your ride that could identify where you live. Since I don't know that information and will upload what you send me, just be mindful.</p>

            <li><em>Lake Como to Montana Ave</em> Fully plowed, 38mm/42mm studded tires</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Cedar Lake Regional Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Midtown Greenway to Minnesota River Bluffs Regional Trail</em> Fully plowed, a mix of bare pavement and light layer of snow. Very good on 38mm/30mm studded tires, and road crossings are generally snow mound-free.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Lake Minnetonka LRT Regional Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>8th Ave S (Hopkins) to Water St (Excelsior)</em> Trail is plowed, but some portions of the trail have deeper snow which made the ride feel extra bumpy. These areas with deeper snow, such as through residential/downtown Hopkins and going by Lake Minnetonka near Deephaven/Greenwood, did not feel slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires, they just required more effort to keep pedaling and were much more bumpy. </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Mill St/Powers Blvd</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>MN-7 to Holly Lane</em> Road is fully plowed, however the shoulder (which I treated as a bike lane) is either unplowed or icy. I took the road </li>
            <li><em>Holly Lane to Saddlebrook Curve</em> Fully plowed trail here, very impressed with how clear all the intersections were. Very confident on 38mm/30mm studded tires. However, at Saddlebrook Curve, the trail ceases to exist and I had to go on the road.</li>
            <li><em>Saddlebrook Curve to 78th St</em> Unfortunately, the Powers Blvd bike trail disappeared at Saddlebrook Curve, so I biked in the shoulder. It was icy, but I didn't slip on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>78th St to Lake Dr</em> Fully plowed, including intersections.  intersections didn't have large snow mounds, but rather bumpy ice at crosswalks, especially at 78th St and MN-5. Not a big deal on 38mm/30mm studded tires, but use caution. Underneath the freight rail bridge, the wake from the road snow plow created a lot of ice balls on the trail, which was unfortunate. </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Lake Susan shared use path</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Fully plowed trails. Mix of bare pavement and packed snow, comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires, no slipping.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Rice Marsh Lake shared use path</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Fully plowed trails. Mix of bare pavement and packed snow, comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires, no slipping. Just after going underneath the highway (US 212), there was some mushy snow that I had to dismount to get through, but not a big deal all things considered. </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Lake Riley Blvd</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Lake Riley Dr to Minnesota River Bluffs Regional Trail</em> Fully plowed trails. Trail is slightly deeper than the trails at Rice Marsh Lake, but not slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Minnesota River Bluffs Regional Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Riley Lake Rd to 62nd St</em> Fully plowed trail, fairly consistent thin layer of snow on the aggregate. In the parts that were a little deeper, I followed the tire marks of the snow plow to make it easier to pedal in my 38mm/30mm studded tires. There's a fairly big hump of ice/snow at Dell Rd, crossable on my bike but not a good time. The crossing at Eden Prairie Road was terrible - 3+ ft snow mound that I dismounted and carried my bike over. </li>
            <li><em>62nd St underpass</em> Completely unplowed, deep snow everywhere. I took the frontage road and biked on the shared use path along 62nd St.</li>
            <li><em>62nd St to Shady Oak Road</em> Fully plowed and I felt stable on 38mm/30mm studded tires. Shared path on 62nd St was bumpy, but this part of the trail all the way to Shady Oak Rd was fairly bumpy the whole way. The snow was deeper than the rest of the trail and I felt I had to use a lot more effort to pedal than in previous portions of the trail.</li>
            <li><em>Cedar Lake Regional Trail (Excelsior Blvd) to Shady Oak Road</em> Fully plowed, a mix of bare pavement and light layer of snow. Very good on 38mm/30mm studded tires, and road crossings are generally snow mound-free.</li>                                    
          </ul>
          <li><b>North Cedar Lake Regional Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Cedar Lake Regional Trail (Excelsior Blvd) to Cedar Lake Pkwy</em> Fully plowed with a mix of packed snow and bare pavement, did not feel slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires. Unfortunately at the trail entrance off Excelsior (next to US 169), wake from the road snow plow put a bunch of ice chunks on the trail for about 50 ft. The rest of the trail was well plowed. </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Cedar Lake Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Cedar Lake Pkwy to Van White Memorial Blvd</em> Fully plowed with a mix of packed snow and bare pavement, did not feel slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires. Unfortunately at the trail entrance off Excelsior (next to US 169), wake from the road snow plow put a bunch of ice chunks on the trail for about 50 ft. The rest of the trail was well plowed. </li>
            <li><em>Van White Memorial Blvd to West River Pwky</em> Before Glenwood Ave, mostly packed snow, but after getting into downtown, a mix of bare pavement or thin layer of packed snow. Did not feel slippery. However, after Azine Way (going by the Federal Reserve building), the snow was deeper so it felt bumpier there. Not slippery, but not as comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires. </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>West River Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Cedar Lake Trail to 38th St</em> Fully plowed, mostly packed snow on this trail. Most intersections are clear of snow mounds and the trail did not feel slippery or bumpy on 38mm/30mm studded tires. Very happy with this trail.</li>

          <li><b>Hennepin Ave</b></li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>Riverside Ave to 4th St SE</em> Fully plowed, some deeper snow on the bridge crossing Washington Ave, was slightly slippery there, but overall well plowed. Mostly stable on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>4th St SE to 8th St SE</em> Poorly plowed, especially right before 6th St SE. A lot of slush from the parking lot intersecting. Snow is fairly deep and slushy in this part of the bike lane, making it difficult to ride in. Road is fully plowed.</li>

Use caution, deeper snow in a couple of places, like right before 23rd Ave NE. Okay on 38mm/30mm studded tires, but used caution. Some crosswalks, like at 19th Ave NE, are not well plowed. As the snow hardens, it is getting harder and harder to just ride through these snow mounds.</li>

            <li><em>Monroe Ave to Stinson Blvd</em> Fully plowed, with thin layer of packed snow on the trail. Plowing job is even, gets a little messy @ Stinson Blvd, where you need to carry your bike over the snow mound to cross Stinson. Good riding experience on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>Washington Ave NE to California St NE</em> Fully plowed. When it drops you onto California St, there's a large enough mound that I had to fully dismount and haul the bike over. A momentary inconvenience that I don't imagine it going away anytime soon, and I would say it's impassable with a cargo bike or if you are not fully able-bodied. </li>

Some intersections, most notably @ Stinson/New Brighton Blvd had huge snow mounds at crossings. At rougher intersections with roads (i.e., on dry pavement your bike thunks when going down to the road), the snow could be a bit slippery. Some of the plowing was uneven on the trail, meaning it was slippery in a couple places with 38mm/30mm studded tires. Under I-35W was one place I noticed that was a little slippery. On street section of this trail was mixed in terms of plowing. For the most part positive, but intersections with driveways were more slushy. Bare pavement going by the Target. </li>
            <li><em>Como Ave to Elm St</em> Road was barely plowed, very slushy and sliding around a lot on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

Trail entrance at the south side of Hwy 55 is a bit dicey because the plow entered the trail at the wrong location (directly from the Pkwy instead of on the corner). I didn't have to dismount or push with my legs but some might, as there was also some deeper snow.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>Godfrey Pkwy to Franklin Ave</em> Recently plowed. At intersections with parking lots and major roads, large snow mounds were present, especially by Minnehaha Falls. Going north, I felt like the right side of the trail was not as well plowed as the left, the right felt more bumpy. Didn't feel unsafe, just not as comfortable. The parking lot by Lock and Dam 1 was pretty bad. Between the Greenway and Franklin Ave, there were a couple areas where the snow was deeper in the northbound trail lane. Overall, the trail can be inconsistent, I felt slippery once over the entire trail on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>Hennepin Ave to Cedar Lake Trail</em> plowed with just a thin layer of snow on top of the pavement. Some sections, particularly around Central Ave. and Nicollet Island were a bit trickier, due to the mounds of wet slushy snow near intersections, directly in the path of pedestrians and cyclists wanting to cross. The little bit of pavement before crossing W River Parkway was completely unplowed but I was able to power through it on a unicycle (29x2.4" tire no studs) so a fat bike or something could probably handle it.</li>

        <h4>It snowed today! Based on the sidewalk outside my house (which was shoveled before it started snowing), we got about 0.2 inches of snow, as of 1am on 2025-12-7. All of these reports were made BEFORE that snow fall, so keep that in mind.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>40th St (RiverLake Greenway)</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 30th Ave S to I-35W</em> Overall disappointing. From 30th Ave S to Cedar Ave, it is a bit slushy, but mostly plowed if you stay in the center of the road. Areas with parked cars have a lot more mushy snow. It was occasionally slippery. From Cedar Ave to I-35W, the plowing was practically nonexistent. Technically, it was plowed, but it didn't feel like it. Very mushy snow, I was slipping constantly with 38mm/30mm studded tires. Frankly, I would rather ride in the road on 42nd St or 38th St.</li>
            <li><em>From I-35W to Bryant Ave</em> Plowed recently. Plow path is not the full width of the bike path, but that was okay. Thin layers of snow in parts, bare pavement most of the time. Very comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Bryant Ave Bikeway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 40th St to Lake St</em> Fully plowed and salted. Barely any snow on this trail, very easy with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>28th St E</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From Bryant Ave to Hennepin Ave</em> Separated bike lane is plowed and salted, not much snow. A few intersections have slush from parking lots or poorly plowed side streets, but it felt fine on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Hennepin Ave</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 28th St to Franklin/Bryant Ave (end)</em> Fully plowed and salted, most intersections were good too, hardly and snow mounds to go over here. The plow isn't quite as wide as the actual path, but there was more than enough room to feel safe on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>Loring Greenway to Washington Ave</em> Hennepin Ave bike lanes are plowed and salted for the most part. Slightly more narrow than usual, but mostly clear (aside from a few patches of snow), good on 38mm/30mm studded tires. There are some patches of unplowed snow, like by the Dominoes, where snow from other shoveling made its way onto the trail. Intersections with parking lots/garages are where the most slush accumulates.</li>
            <li><em>Washington Ave to Hennepin Ave Bridge</em> Bike lane past Washington Ave is unplowed, and the bike path that goes by Gateway Park and the bus station there is unplowed still. not too deep, but it felt pretty slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Loring Greenway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From Bryant Ave to Hennepin Ave exit</em> Paritally plowed, leftover plowing job from last week. This did not feel very good to ride on, slippery and loose snow. With 38mm/30mm studded tires, I was sliding a bit and had to ride on the sidewalk, which was actually shoveled! Inside Loring Park, the bike path was similarly bumpy and uneven. Not great</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>West River Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Hennepin Ave to I-35W</em> Leftover plowing job from last week, trail is bumpy and at some points slippery, especially over the boardwalk. Proceed with caution, even with studded tires like I have (38mm/30mm). Enough people ride on this trail to have cycle tracks, which makes it less bumpy, but still not great.</li>
            <li><em>I-35W to Godfrey Pkwy</em> Recently plowed, thin layer of snow which felt good to ride on. At intersections with parking lots, the snow was slushier. There were occasional uneven spots of plowing, where the snow is slightly deeper, but nothing that my 38mm/30mm couldn't handle.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Horace W.S. Cleveland Overlook</em> The portion where the trail narrows on that bridge by 44th St / Horace W. S. Cleveland Overlook is not plowed well. Slippery ~0.5 inches of snow. It is left over from the last plow. I was slipping on this trail with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From 7th St W to St. Clair Ave</em> The only bike lane I've found this winter that's fully plowed. A bit shaky crossing Ayd Mill Road, but overall a very positive experience with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

            <li><em>Lake St to Sabo Bridge</em> Plowed, light snow covering it. No slipping on 38mm/30mm tires. Not as wide as normal because of snow blowing from the side, but usable.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Lake Nokomis-Minnesota River Regional Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From Richfield Pkwy to Lake Nokomis Pkwy</em> Well plowed, with a couple of uneven spots where the snow is deep (like under the MN-77 bridge). Parts of it, especially from 66th to Lake Nokomis Pkwy, are salted. So I barely saw any snow there at all. I didn't bike on it for long, but 76th St looked plowed looking the other direction.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From southern entrance at Cedar Ave to 22nd Ave S</em> The plowing that was done earlier this week has been snowed on, walked on, and it isn't very good. It felt slippery and bumpy the whole time. This would best be conquered on a fat tire bike, which I don't have. My 38mm/30mm studded tires were tough for this.</li>

However, past 26th St, a couple of residents threw their sidewalk snow into the bikeway. Close to MCAD, a couple of those driveways had a lot of slushy snow that were fine right now (easy ride through), but I worry about that freezing later. Most intersections were good, no big snow drifts I can recall.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Intersection with 28th St</em> There is construction equipment obstructing the trail here, so it is UNPLOWED for about 100 ft after 28th St. You gotta ride on the road here or the unplowed sidewalk around the construction equipment. Caution</li>
