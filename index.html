      <h1>Welcome to my website on MSP winter cycling conditions!</h1>
      <button onclick="toggleDarkMode()">Toggle dark mode</button>
      <p><a href="" id="recentlink">Link to most recent report</a></p>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Owen and I wanted to have a place where people can collectively report on cycling conditions in the Twin Cities metro without having to rely on social media. My main focus has been protected bicycle infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>How will this work?</h2>
      <p>The way this works is (at least for now, until I come up with a more sophisticated way to do this) to manually update the embedded map you see below. On this map, you should be able to see sections of bike trail that are <b>bold.</b> These lines will be <b>thicker</b> than the rest, and if you click on these segments it should give a trail status. I will also put text below in case you don't want to navigate the map.</p>
      <p>Lastly, keep in mind that these are opinions of myself and the people submitting. Based on the bikes people have or their comfort level, these subjective descriptions might clash another's experience.</p>
      <h3>The map will be cleared after heavy snowfall.</h3>
      <p>On this page, I will remove the segments from the embedded map if we get over 2 inches of snowfall. The reason I picked that number is because that is the threshold at which the MPRB starts plowing, and it will take time for everyone else to plow as well. I will make a note in the "Reports" section that a snow event occurred (based on how much snow we get), but I will keep the written reports. Part of my reasoning behind this is that, reports from before the snow event will not be particularly useful. Reach out to me if you have a different view, I want to make this site as useful as possible!</p>
      <h3>Suggestions for submitting</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Tell me about your bike. Tire width and whether or not you have studs are the most important.</li>
        <li>Describe your route.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The most important part is what major bikeway(s) you took!</b> It doesn't need to be turn by turn directions if you don't have time.</li>
          <li>If you want to be more detailed, you could include a Strava link, a Ride with GPS link, screenshot of the route, or a typed out description.</li>
          <li>What were the conditions like? Did it feel plowed? Was it slippery, icy, did you feel comfortable on your bike?</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p><b style="color: lawngreen; background-color: black;">Green</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>fully</b> plowed.</p>
      <p><b style="color: orange; background-color: black;">Orange</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>partially</b> plowed. This will color mostly be used when the trail <em>was</em> plowed at some point, but the ride quality has gotten worse (subjective). For example, if it snowed <em>just enough</em> to not plow again and it's all slippery/bumpy, or if wake from the street plow throws a bunch of chunks on the trail, or if a painted bike lane is unusable.</p>
      <p><b style="color: yellow; background-color: black;">Yellow</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>unplowed</b>.</p>
      <p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/">OpenCycleMap legend</a> for information on other colors. I try to choose colors that don't overlap with these.</p>

    <div id="contact">
      <h2>How do I contact you to update this website?</h2>
      <p>Just like the good old days, send me an email. I will work to update this site quickly. Email me at <a href="mailto:mspwintercycle@gmail.com">mspwintercycle@gmail.com.</a> If you have any suggestions on how to improve this website, please let me know! Obviously having something more automated would be nice, but that seemed like a lot of work, and I wanted to get something up and running.</p>    
    </div>

    <div id="roadcycling">
      <h2>Can I report something that isn't a bike path/off street bike facility?</h2>
      <p>If you want to, of course. In my experience, painted bike lanes often become treacherous in the winter with a combination of slush, ice, and compacted snow. During snow events, however, roads usually get plowed first, so that information could be useful!</p>
      <p>I have had better success with plowing on "bicycle boulevards," such as 40th St (RiverLake Greenway). Information on these roads throughout the Twin Cities (usually they have "BLVD" painted on the asphalt) would be helpful in my opinion.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="privacy">
      <h2>How do you handle privacy?</h2>
      <p>I would encourage everyone submitting information to me to keep in mind this website is public. I won't include names of people who send things to me, and feel free to omit any part of your ride that could identify where you live. Since I don't know that information and will upload what you send me, just be mindful.</p>

        <h4>It snowed today! Based on the sidewalk outside my house (which was shoveled before it started snowing), we got about 0.2 inches of snow, as of 1am on 2025-12-7. All of these reports were made BEFORE that snow fall, so keep that in mind.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>40th St (RiverLake Greenway)</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 30th Ave S to I-35W</em> Overall disappointing. From 30th Ave S to Cedar Ave, it is a bit slushy, but mostly plowed if you stay in the center of the road. Areas with parked cars have a lot more mushy snow. It was occasionally slippery. From Cedar Ave to I-35W, the plowing was practically nonexistent. Technically, it was plowed, but it didn't feel like it. Very mushy snow, I was slipping constantly with 38mm/30mm studded tires. Frankly, I would rather ride in the road on 42nd St or 38th St.</li>
            <li><em>From I-35W to Bryant Ave</em> Plowed recently. Plow path is not the full width of the bike path, but that was okay. Thin layers of snow in parts, bare pavement most of the time. Very comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Bryant Ave Bikeway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 40th St to Lake St</em> Fully plowed and salted. Barely any snow on this trail, very easy with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>28th St E</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From Bryant Ave to Hennepin Ave</em> Separated bike lane is plowed and salted, not much snow. A few intersections have slush from parking lots or poorly plowed side streets, but it felt fine on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Hennepin Ave</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 28th St to Franklin/Bryant Ave (end)</em> Fully plowed and salted, most intersections were good too, hardly and snow mounds to go over here. The plow isn't quite as wide as the actual path, but there was more than enough room to feel safe on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>Loring Greenway to Washington Ave</em> Hennepin Ave bike lanes are plowed and salted for the most part. Slightly more narrow than usual, but mostly clear (aside from a few patches of snow), good on 38mm/30mm studded tires. There are some patches of unplowed snow, like by the Dominoes, where snow from other shoveling made its way onto the trail. Intersections with parking lots/garages are where the most slush accumulates.</li>
            <li><em>Washington Ave to Hennepin Ave Bridge</em> Bike lane past Washington Ave is unplowed, and the bike path that goes by Gateway Park and the bus station there is unplowed still. not too deep, but it felt pretty slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Loring Greenway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From Bryant Ave to Hennepin Ave exit</em> Paritally plowed, leftover plowing job from last week. This did not feel very good to ride on, slippery and loose snow. With 38mm/30mm studded tires, I was sliding a bit and had to ride on the sidewalk, which was actually shoveled! Inside Loring Park, the bike path was similarly bumpy and uneven. Not great</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>West River Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Hennepin Ave to I-35W</em> Leftover plowing job from last week, trail is bumpy and at some points slippery, especially over the boardwalk. Proceed with caution, even with studded tires like I have (38mm/30mm). Enough people ride on this trail to have cycle tracks, which makes it less bumpy, but still not great.</li>
            <li><em>I-35W to Godfrey Pkwy</em> Recently plowed, thin layer of snow which felt good to ride on. At intersections with parking lots, the snow was slushier. There were occasional uneven spots of plowing, where the snow is slightly deeper, but nothing that my 38mm/30mm couldn't handle.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Horace W.S. Cleveland Overlook</em> The portion where the trail narrows on that bridge by 44th St / Horace W. S. Cleveland Overlook is not plowed well. Slippery ~0.5 inches of snow. It is left over from the last plow. I was slipping on this trail with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Lexington Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 7th St W to St. Clair Ave</em> The only bike lane I've found this winter that's fully plowed. A bit shaky crossing Ayd Mill Road, but overall a very positive experience with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Hiawatha LRT Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From 35th St to 38th St</em> Unplowed and slippery on studded tires.</li>

          <li><b>10th Ave S</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Midtown Global Market to 31st St</em> Unplowed and slippery on studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>31st St to 34th St, along Powderhorn Park</em> well plowed, so good, green quality - with studded tires</li>

            <li><em>Sabo Bridge</em> Sabo bridge is not fully plowed. Slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires. Remnants of an old plowing job.</li>

          <li><b>1st Ave S Bikeway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>From Lake St to 15th St</em> Plowed today, salted in some places where no snow was present. Didnt see ice and didn’t slip on 38mm/30mm tires. However, past 26th St, a couple of residents threw their sidewalk snow into the bikeway. Close to MCAD, a couple of those driveways had a lot of slushy snow that were fine right now (easy ride through), but I worry about that freezing later. Most intersections were good, no big snow drifts I can recall.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Intersection with 28th St</em> There is construction equipment obstructing the trail here, so it is UNPLOWED for about 100 ft after 28th St. You gotta ride on the road here or the unplowed sidewalk around the construction equipment. Caution</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From Minnehaha Ave to 46th St</em> Packed snow and well plowed. Feels like it was done today, on 38mm/30mm studded tires I felt confident on this portion. A few spots on the minnehaha creek trail intersected with bridges that were unplowed, but for the most part, good.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From 46th St to 38th St</em> Leftover plowing job earlier this week is getting worse, unfortunately. I biked in the tracks of a few fat tire bikers in my 38mm/30mm studded tires. It was better packed than Nokomis, but my rear wheel was slipping a little.</li>
