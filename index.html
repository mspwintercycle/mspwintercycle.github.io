      <p>Hello there! My name is Owen and I wanted to have a place where people can collectively report on cycling conditions in the Twin Cities metro without having to rely on social media. My main focus has been protected bicycle infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>How will this work?</h2>
      <p>The way this works is (at least for now, until I come up with a more sophisticated way to do this) to manually update the embedded map you see below. On this map, you should be able to see sections of bike trail that are <b>bold.</b> These lines will be <b>thicker</b> than the rest, and if you click on these segments it should give a trail status. I will also put text below in case you don't want to navigate the map.</p>
      <p>Lastly, keep in mind that these are opinions of myself and the people submitting. Based on the bikes people have or their comfort level, these subjective descriptions might clash another's experience.</p>
      <h3>The map will expire after heavy snowfall.</h3>
      <p>On this page, if we get over 2 inches of snowfall, all previous reports will be marked as "expired" (dark gray on map). The reason I picked that number is because that is the threshold at which the MPRB declares a snow event, and it will take time for everyone else to plow as well. I will make a note in the "Reports" section that a snow event occurred (based on how much snow we get), but I will keep the written reports. Part of my reasoning behind this is that reports from before the snow event will not be particularly useful. This approach will let users see previous reports to get an idea of what that trail looked like plowed. Reach out to me if you have a different view, I want to make this site as useful as possible!</p>
      <h3>Suggestions for submitting</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Tell me about your bike. Tire width and whether or not you have studs are the most important.</li>
        <li>Describe your route.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The most important part is what major bikeway(s) you took!</b> It doesn't need to be turn by turn directions if you don't have time.</li>
          <li>If you want to be more detailed, you could include a Strava link, a Ride with GPS link, screenshot of the route, or a typed out description.</li>
          <li>What were the conditions like? Did it feel plowed? Was it slippery, icy, did you feel comfortable on your bike?</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3>Colors for user reports</h3>
      <p><b style="color: lawngreen; background-color: black;">Green</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>fully</b> plowed.</p>
      <p><b style="color: orange; background-color: black;">Orange</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>partially</b> plowed. This will color mostly be used when the trail <em>was</em> plowed at some point, but the ride quality has gotten worse (subjective). For example, if it snowed <em>just enough</em> to not plow again and it's all slippery/bumpy, or if wake from the street plow throws a bunch of chunks on the trail, or if a painted bike lane is unusable.</p>
      <p><b style="color: yellow; background-color: black;">Yellow</b> lines on the map represent bike trails that are <b>unplowed</b>.</p>
      <p><b style="color: lightgray; background-color: black;">Gray</b> lines on the map represent <b>expired</b> reports from <b>before</b> a major snow event. These are there for context only, in case anyone wants to view old reports on the map easily.</p>
      <p><b style="color: palevioletred; background-color: black;">Pink</b> markers on the map represent large snow mounds at intersections.</p>
      <h3>Other colors</h3>
      <p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/">OpenCycleMap legend</a> for information on other colors. I try to choose colors that don't overlap with these.</p>

      <h2>How do I contact you to update this website?</h2>
      <p>Just like the good old days, send me an email. I will work to update this site quickly. Email me at <a href="mailto:mspwintercycle@gmail.com">mspwintercycle@gmail.com.</a> If you have any suggestions on how to improve this website, please let me know! Obviously having something more automated would be nice, but that seemed like a lot of work, and I wanted to get something up and running.</p>

    <div id="roadcycling">
      <h2>Can I report something that isn't a bike path/off street bike facility?</h2>
      <p>If you want to, of course. In my experience, painted bike lanes often become treacherous in the winter with a combination of slush, ice, and compacted snow. During snow events, however, roads usually get plowed first, so that information could be useful!</p>
      <p>I have had better success with plowing on "bicycle boulevards," such as 40th St (RiverLake Greenway). Information on these roads throughout the Twin Cities (usually they have "BLVD" painted on the asphalt) would be helpful in my opinion.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="privacy">
      <h2>How do you handle privacy?</h2>
      <p>I would encourage everyone submitting information to me to keep in mind this website is public. I won't include names of people who send things to me, and feel free to omit any part of your ride that could identify where you live. Since I don't know that information and will upload what you send me, just be mindful.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Lake St</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Hiawatha Ave to Mississippi River</em> Clear/plowed, wet but not slippery (heavily salted). Some slush/smaller mounds at B Line stops. 700x28, front studs only.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Kellogg Blvd</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Summit Ave to 7th St</em> Clear, not slippery.</li>

          <li><b>7th St (St. Paul)</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Kellogg Blvd to Robert St</em> Clear, not slippery.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Marshall Ave</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Mississippi River to Lexington Pkwy</em> Clear/plowed to straddle the left line of the bike lane. Slippery at a few points. Occasional small mounds at side street intersections but hefty salt left them rendered mostly slushy. Actual bike lane has parked cars and compacted mounds of snow and slush. Straddling bike lane/traffic yields decent riding, otherwise take the lane if comfortable. 700x28, front studs only. Bike lane is plowed on Mississippi River bridge.</li>
            <li><em>Lexington Pkwy to Summit Ave</em> Partially plowed. Due to lower traffic, lots of small mounds / drag from side streets, slippery.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Phalen Blvd Bikeway (merges with Bruce Vento Regional Trail)</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>I-35E to Lake Phalen</em> Fully plowed, plowed down or near down to pavement. No issues with 4.5 inch half studded tires, a few slick spots along Phalen Blvd, but any size studded tire should work.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Bruce Vento Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Lake Phalen to Gateway Trail</em> Fully plowed, plowed down or near down to pavement. No issues with 4.5 inch half studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Gateway State Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Bruce Vento Trail to White Bear Ave</em>  Fully plowed, plowed down or near down to pavement. No issues with 4.5 inch half studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>1st Ave NE Bikeway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>1st Ave NE & 4th St NE</em> 3 foot tall pile of snow in the bikeway. Otherwise, bikeway is is plowed.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>19th Ave S/10th Ave SE Bikeway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Riverside Ave to 4th St SE</em> Fully plowed, some deeper snow on the bridge crossing Washington Ave, was slightly slippery there, but overall well plowed. Mostly stable on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>4th St SE to 8th St SE</em> Poorly plowed, especially right before 6th St SE. A lot of slush from the parking lot intersecting. Snow is fairly deep and slushy in this part of the bike lane, making it difficult to ride in. Road is fully plowed.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Johnson St NE MUP</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>16th Ave NE to Lowry Ave NE</em> Plowed the night of 2025-12-9, packed snow, but can be uneven at times. Use caution, deeper snow in a couple of places, like right before 23rd Ave NE. Mostly comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires, but used caution. Some crosswalks, like at 19th Ave NE, are not well plowed. As the snow hardens, it is getting harder and harder to just ride through these snow mounds.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Great Northern Greenway</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Monroe Ave to Stinson Blvd</em> Fully plowed, with thin layer of packed snow on the trail. Plowing job is even, gets a little messy @ Stinson Blvd, where you need to carry your bike over the snow mound to cross Stinson. Good riding experience on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>Washington Ave NE to California St NE</em> Fully plowed</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Diagonal Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Fully plowed</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Stinson Blvd/18th Ave SE</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Great Northern Greenway to Como Ave</em> Fully plowed with packed snow along the trail. Some intersections, most notably @ Stinson/New Brighton Blvd had huge snow mounds at crossings. At rougher intersections with roads (i.e., on dry pavement your bike thunks when going down to the road), the snow could be a bit slippery. Some of the plowing was uneven on the trail, meaning it was slippery in a couple places with 38mm/30mm studded tires. Under I-35W was one place I noticed that was a little slippery. On street section of this trail was mixed in terms of plowing. For the most part positive, but intersections with driveways were more slushy. </li>
            <li><em>Como Ave to Elm St</em> Road was barely plowed, very slushy and sliding around a lot on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Stone Arch Bridge</b></li>
          <ul>

          <ul>
            <li><em>Central Ave to 15th Ave SE</em> Fully plowed, including bridge over I-35W</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>6th Ave SE bike blvd</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Stone Arch Bridge to 8th St SE</em> Reported fully plowed</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Elm St SE/Kasota Ave SE/Energy Park Dr</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>18th Ave SE to Raymond Ave</em> Road was clear, but on street bike lanes an Elm/Kasota/Energy Park Dr were non existent. </li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Mississippi East Bank Trail</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>16th Ave NE to Plymouth Ave</em> Fully plowed</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Plymouth Ave N</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Graco Park to Theo Wirth Pkwy</em> Bikeway is fully plowed</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Theo Wirth Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Plymouth Ave to Cedar Lake Rd</em> Fully plowed - note on 394 bridge sidewalk, it is unplowed but it diverts you onto the cleared parkway and back onto the bike path</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Cedar Lake Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>

          <li><b>West River Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Stone Arch Bridge to Greenway</em> Bikeway is fully plowed</li>
            <li><em>Lake St to Godfrey Pkwy</em> Trail is well plowed. Snow is more packed than on 2025-12-10, and intersections with parking lots don't have as much snow packed at them, much easier to cross at intersections. Plowing has mostly evened out at this point for both directions of travel, from my experience. Very comfortable riding experience on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>46th St</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Mississippi River to Minnehaha Ave</em> Road was clear, but on street bike lane came in and out of existence. For the most part there was slush in the bike lane, so I took the lane with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Minnehaha Ave</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>46th St to 32nd St</em> Both directions of the bike lane are useless, occluded at nearly every intersection with snow piles and parked cars. Street is slippery. Take the lane or find a different route otherwise you'll be zig-zagging every thirty feet.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Well plowed packed snow on this trail, and did not feel slushy or uneven. Intersections with roads were for the most part clean, a small amount of snow at intersection Beverly Road but very passable on 38mm/30mm studded tires. High quality plowing job.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>Sibley St to I-35E</em> Inadvisable travel. Thin layer of slush that refroze due to no drainage - currently mushy/crunchy and rapidly freezing. Will be very slippery soon with rough, variable surfaces. 28mm front studded tire only.</li>
            <li><em>I-35E to Hwy 5</em> Thin layer of compacted snow, slippery. Manageable but slow and unpleasant, lots of piles. 28mm front studded tire only.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>Bryn Mawr Park to Thomas Ave/Inglewood Ave</em> The bike paths were pretty well cleared, with a thin layer of compacted snow on the ground the whole way. Transition between Bryn Mawr Park and Cedar Lake Rd as well as Chestnut Ave and Luce Line Regional Trail are slushy and bad. Especially large snow mound @ Luce Line Regional Trail & Thomas Ave, so bad that I had to dismount my bike to get through the huge pile of snow and slush at the entrance</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Hiawatha LRT Trail</b></li>
          <ul>

          <li><b>Godfrey Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Minnehaha Falls to 46th St</em> Packed snow and well plowed. Intersections with any road or parking lot can be sketchy, large snow mounds present. Snow on the trail is well plowed, mostly all the same depth. Didn't feel slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires, but occasionally there is a slightly unplowed section, so stay alert. The intersection at 46th Ave there is a large snow mound.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>West River Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Godfrey Pkwy to Franklin Ave</em> Recently plowed. At intersections with parking lots and major roads, large snow mounds were present, especially by Minnehaha Falls. Going north, I felt like the right side of the trail was not as well plowed as the left, the right felt more bumpy. Didn't feel unsafe, just not as comfortable. The parking lot by Lock and Dam 1 was pretty bad. Between the Greenway and Franklin Ave, there were a couple areas where the snow was deeper in the northbound trail lane. Overall, the trail can be inconsistent, I felt slippery once over the entire trail on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>
            <li><em>Hennepin Ave to Cedar Lake Trail</em> plowed with just a thin layer of snow on top of the pavement. Some sections, particularly around Central Ave. and Nicollet Island were a bit trickier, due to the mounds of wet slushy snow near intersections, directly in the path of pedestrians and cyclists wanting to cross. The little bit of pavement before crossing W River Parkway was completely unplowed but I was able to power through it on a unicycle (29x2.4" tire no studs) so a fat bike or something could probably handle it.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From 30th Ave S to I-35W</em> Overall disappointing. From 30th Ave S to Cedar Ave, it is a bit slushy, but mostly plowed if you stay in the center of the road. Areas with parked cars have a lot more mushy snow. It was occasionally slippery. From Cedar Ave to I-35W, the plowing was practically nonexistent. Technically, it was plowed, but it didn't feel like it. Very mushy snow, I was slipping constantly with 38mm/30mm studded tires. Frankly, I would rather ride in the road on 42nd St or 38th St.</li>
            <li><em>From I-35W to Bryant Ave</em> Plowed recently. Plow path is not the full width of the bike path, but that was okay. Thin layers of snow in parts, bare pavement most of the time. Very comfortable on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From Bryant Ave to Hennepin Ave</em> Separated bike lane is plowed and salted, not much snow. A few intersections have slush from parking lots or poorly plowed side streets, but it felt fine on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

            <li><em>Loring Greenway to Washington Ave</em> Hennepin Ave bike lanes are plowed and salted for the most part. Slightly more narrow than usual, but mostly clear (aside from a few patches of snow), good on 38mm/30mm studded tires. There are some patches of unplowed snow, like by the Dominoes, where snow from other shoveling made its way onto the trail. Intersections with parking lots/garages are where the most slush accumulates.</li>
            <li><em>Washington Ave to Hennepin Ave Bridge</em> Bike lane past Washington Ave is unplowed, and the bike path that goes by Gateway Park and the bus station there is unplowed still. not too deep, but it felt pretty slippery on 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><em>From Bryant Ave to Hennepin Ave exit</em> Paritally plowed, leftover plowing job from last week. This did not feel very good to ride on, slippery and loose snow. With 38mm/30mm studded tires, I was sliding a bit and had to ride on the sidewalk, which was actually shoveled! Inside Loring Park, the bike path was similarly bumpy and uneven. Not great</li>

          <li><b>West River Pkwy</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Hennepin Ave to I-35W</em> Leftover plowing job from last week, trail is bumpy and at some points slippery, especially over the boardwalk. Proceed with caution, even with studded tires like I have (38mm/30mm). Enough people ride on this trail to have cycle tracks, which makes it less bumpy, but still not great.</li>
            <li><em>I-35W to Godfrey Pkwy</em> Recently plowed, thin layer of snow which felt good to ride on. At intersections with parking lots, the snow was slushier. There were occasional uneven spots of plowing, where the snow is slightly deeper, but nothing that my 38mm/30mm couldn't handle.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Horace W.S. Cleveland Overlook</em> The portion where the trail narrows on that bridge by 44th St / Horace W. S. Cleveland Overlook is not plowed well. Slippery ~0.5 inches of snow. It is left over from the last plow. I was slipping on this trail with 38mm/30mm studded tires.</li>

            <li>well plowed, packed snow. crosswalks were mostly plowed. however, the parts where you share the road, the st. paul roads are mushy and i didnt always feel stable on the side streets. i opted to take the sidewalk in some of these parts.</li>

            <li><em>11th Ave S to 46th St Station</em>Plowed, but uneven at some points and has ice patches. South of Lake St, I noticed one side of the trail had slightly deeper snow than the other.

North of Lake St, the snow depth felt more consistent but there were still ice patches throughout the trail.</li>
